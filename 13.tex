\section{Lecture 13}

We now resume our discussion on bounding the $MD_{p,n}(R)$ in the critical exponent $\frac{2n}{n-1}\leq p\leq\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$.

We illustrate how we will bound this by a simple example.
Let $G$ be a nonnegative, non-decreasing function such that for all $R>0$, we have
\begin{equation*}
    G(R)\leq CG(R^{1/2})^{3/2}
\end{equation*}
